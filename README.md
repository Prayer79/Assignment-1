1. Broken Down Requirements

From the initial information gathered, the primary concerns revolve around onboarding challenges for employees and clients. Below is a breakdown of the requirements:

Employee Onboarding Process Improvement

1. Reduce onboarding time for new employees from 3 months to a shorter, more efficient timeline.
2. Standardize the training process so all employees receive consistent information.
3. Develop clear documentation or a training program that can be used across all new hires.

Client Onboarding Simplification

1. Create a structured and easy-to-follow client onboarding process.
2. Ensure all employees follow the same onboarding steps to maintain consistency.
3. Design a clear communication flow so that customers know what to expect at each stage.

4. Questions & Intended Knowledge Exposure

To gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced, I will ask the following questions:

Employee Onboarding

1. What steps are currently involved in onboarding a new employee?
2. What are the biggest challenges new employees face during the first three months?
3. Are there any existing training materials or standardized procedures in place?
4. Who is responsible for training new hires, and how is the training conducted?
5. What tools or systems are used for employee onboarding (e.g., HR software, checklists, mentorship programs)?

Client Onboarding

6. Can you describe the current client onboarding process step-by-step?
7. What specific challenges do employees face when onboarding a new client?
8. Are there any existing guidelines for handling new clients, or does each employee create their own approach?
9. What are the most common complaints from customers about the onboarding experience?
10. How is customer information collected and stored?
11. Are there any digital tools being used for client onboarding, or is it a manual process?
